<p>The primary reason for setting up admin users and groups is to be able to control access to the documents in the Document Tree. Admin interface users are stored separately from web (front-end) users for security reasons. A web user cannot log into the back-end nor can an Admin user log into the web site (front-end).</p>
<p>Admin Roles are also used to control access to system management functions.</p>
<p>Each admin user is assigned a Role that controls what permissions he is granted in areas of system and user administration and document management. An Admin user can only be assigned one Role.</p>
<p>Admin users are assigned to one or more admin user groups:</p>
<p>Both "Admin User Groups" and "Web User Groups" can be assigned to the same "Document Group."</p>
